This program is the first assignment of Gebze Technical University

Computer Engineering Department of Numerical Analysis course.

Written by Salih Bektaş.

The C programming language was used.

A function written in the program finds its root by applying the bisection method.

Change the function in the required format before the program is compiled and run.

Since the math.h library is being used, the -lm flag of gcc must be used on linking.

Makefile can be used for compiling and linking.
